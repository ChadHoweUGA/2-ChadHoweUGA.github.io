## Graduate Coordinator

I serve as [Graduate Coordinator](https://www.linguistics.uga.edu/graduate-program) in the Department of Linguistics. Current students should feel free to contact me regarding advisement and any other program-related questions. Prospective students are encouraged to contact me as well with questions related to UGA's graduate offerings in linguistics. Below are a few helpful links for students (current and prospective):

- [UGA Graduate School](https://grad.uga.edu/)
- [UGA Grad School Calendar](https://grad.uga.edu/index.php/current-students/important-dates-deadlines/)
- [UGA Department of Linguistics Graduate Handbook](https://ling.franklin.uga.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Graduate%20Handbook%20Revised%20July%202019.pdf)

## Review Editor for SHLL

I also serve as the Review Editor for the journal [Studies in Hispanic and Lusophone Linguistics](https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/shll/shll-overview.xml?language=en&tab_body=editorialContent-75079). Reviews of academic books (e.g., monographs, edited volumes, handbooks, etc.) are generally solicited individually. If you would like for your book or volume to be considered for a review in SHLL, please have your commissioning editor arrange for a copy to be delivered to us. If you are working on a review, I strongly suggest reading the many excellent samples that have been published in previous volumes. There are also a number of useful guides and how-to's available that can help you as you put together your submission--such as [this article by Casey Brienza from Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2015/03/27/essay-writing-academic-book-reviews) and [this insightful resource prepared by Tala Khanmalek](https://ideasonfire.net/how-to-write-a-book-review/).

<!--
It's possible to create well-designed websites for free using [RStudio's R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and hosting them on [Github](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. It is a really powerful way to communicate science using the same reproducible workflow you use for your analyses and collaborations.

***Creating websites with R Markdown can be done without knowing R or HTML, CSS, etc,*** and that's where we'll start. However, R Markdown integrates with these tools so the more you know the more complex and beautiful your website can be. This tutorial borrows heavily from a lot of great tutorials and resources you should check out too -- there are links throughout. 

The best way to learn is to follow along with your own laptop, but all are welcome. We'll spend half the time with the tutorial and half the time for you to work on your own website and get help. If you bring your laptop please do this beforehand: 

1. install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
1. create a [GitHub]((http://github.com)) account ([advice](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html))
1. set up your computer to talk to GitHub
    - have RStudio linked directly (preferred) ([instructions sections 8-14](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html))
    - or install the [Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/)
    - or be familiar with git commands for the command line ([tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1))

----


**Examples:**

We have been using R Markdown for the Ocean Health Index:  [**ohi-science.org/ohi-global**](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global).  
And R Markdown is much more than just websites -- here's a [**one-minute video about R Markdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) to get you excited.
