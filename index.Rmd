  <summary><span style="color: red;">Current Schedule (Spring 2022)</span></summary>
<br>

<div class="well well-sm">
<details>
  <summary>**Text and Corpus Linguistics** (LING 4886/6886): Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:35-10:50</summary>
<br>
**Course Description:** A "corpus"''" (plural: corpora)  is a computerized collection of text or speech. This course introduces the use of corpora to study language. These studies span academic disciplines from formal linguistics to literary analysis. We pursue them using tools like the [IMS Open Corpus Workbench](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/). However, no programming is required.  Guided by the instructor and TA, students complete an original final project
exploring some aspect of corpus~analysis that is of special interest to them. (co-taught with Dr. John Hale)

<details>
  <summary>**Variation and Sociolinguistics in Spanish** (SPAN/LING 6450): Tuesdays and Thursdays, 12:45-2:00</summary>
<br>
**Descripción del curso:** Este curso les ofrecerá una introducción al estudio de la variación lingüística y la sociolingüística en la lengua española. Los temas que investigaremos durante el curso incluirá (i) el estudio de los dialectos (es decir, la dialectología), (ii) la clasificación y análisis de los rasgos dialectales, y (iii) los factores (geográficos, sociales, y lingüísticos) que influyen en la variación dialectal. Examinaremos casos específicos de los dialectos españoles en la Península Ibérica, América Latina, los Estados Unidos y otros lugares, describiendo también unas de las fuentes históricas de la variación lingüística. Describiremos también el efecto de contacto lingüístico y bilingüismo ysu rol en el desarrollo de la lengua. La clase tendrá un componente analítico en que los alumnos tendrán que analizar el ‘habla’ y aplicar unos técnicos comunes de la sociolingüística y la dialectología.

  <summary><span style="color: green;">Graduate Coordinator (Department of Linguistics)</span></summary>
<br>
I serve as [Graduate Coordinator](https://www.linguistics.uga.edu/graduate-program) in the Department of Linguistics. Current students should feel free to contact me regarding advisement and any other program-related questions. Prospective students are encouraged to contact me as well with questions related to UGA's graduate offerings in linguistics. Below are a few helpful links for students (current and prospective):

- [UGA Graduate School](https://grad.uga.edu/)
- [UGA Grad School Calendar](https://grad.uga.edu/index.php/current-students/important-dates-deadlines/)
- [UGA Department of Linguistics Graduate Handbook](https://ling.franklin.uga.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Graduate%20Handbook%20Revised%20July%202019.pdf)

As you start the process of starting and managing a graduate program in linguistics, potential applicants should take some time to read about the challenges of pursuing a post-graduate degree. Below are a few resources that are definitely worth a read.

  <summary><span style="color: brown;">Review Editor for SHLL</span></summary>
<br>
I also serve as the Review Editor for the journal [Studies in Hispanic and Lusophone Linguistics](https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/shll/shll-overview.xml?language=en&tab_body=editorialContent-75079). Reviews of academic books (e.g., monographs, edited volumes, handbooks, etc.) are generally solicited individually. If you would like for your book or volume to be considered for a review in SHLL, please have your commissioning editor arrange for a copy to be delivered to us. If you are working on a review, I strongly suggest reading the many excellent samples that have been published in previous volumes. There are also a number of useful guides and how-to's available that can help you as you put together your submission--such as [this article by Casey Brienza from Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2015/03/27/essay-writing-academic-book-reviews) and [this insightful resource prepared by Tala Khanmalek](https://ideasonfire.net/how-to-write-a-book-review/).

<summary><span style="color: orange;">Franklin Diversity Fellows ('21-'23)</span></summary>

In Fall 2021, I was chosen to participate in the 2021-23 cohort of the Franklin Diversity Fellows (formerly known as the [Administrative Fellows in Diversity Leadership](https://www.franklin.uga.edu/sites/default/files/Administrative%20Fellows%20in%20Diversity%20Leadership.pdf)). This opportunity is coordinated by Dr. Jean Martin-Williams, Associate Dean in Franklin College, and Nakia Wade, and I'll be joined in this venture by Dr. Carolyn Medine, Professor of Religion and Director of the [Institute of African American Studies](https://afam.uga.edu/). I am honoured, and quite frankly humbled, to have been selected and look forward to engaging and productive experience learning about about DEI initiatives at UGA and in the broader academic community.

It's possible to create well-designed websites for free using [RStudio's R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and hosting them on [Github](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. It is a really powerful way to communicate science using the same reproducible workflow you use for your analyses and collaborations.

***Creating websites with R Markdown can be done without knowing R or HTML, CSS, etc,*** and that's where we'll start. However, R Markdown integrates with these tools so the more you know the more complex and beautiful your website can be. This tutorial borrows heavily from a lot of great tutorials and resources you should check out too -- there are links throughout. 

The best way to learn is to follow along with your own laptop, but all are welcome. We'll spend half the time with the tutorial and half the time for you to work on your own website and get help. If you bring your laptop please do this beforehand: 

1. install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
1. create a [GitHub]((http://github.com)) account ([advice](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html))
1. set up your computer to talk to GitHub
    - have RStudio linked directly (preferred) ([instructions sections 8-14](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html))
    - or install the [Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/)
    - or be familiar with git commands for the command line ([tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1))

----


**Examples:**

We have been using R Markdown for the Ocean Health Index:  [**ohi-science.org/ohi-global**](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global).  
And R Markdown is much more than just websites -- here's a [**one-minute video about R Markdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) to get you excited.
