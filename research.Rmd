My primary area of research is language variation and change, focusing on structural phenomena in the Romance Languages. More generally, I investigate the forces that shape language use and the subsequent effect that these forces have on how language evolves. The most recent extension of this research involves analyzed data from social media for evidence of language change. I am also involved in work related to Spanish/Quechua contact. For a full list of research-related goings on, please [see my current CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12AJlAyBTaXN46iEJOa2ko8zDzXhHKNwI).

## Research Interests

## Current Projects

### Incipient language shift in a southern Latino community
This project was developed in collaboration with the Roswell Voices project, which began in 2002 as a partnership between researchers at the University of Georgia (Professors William A. Kretzschmar, Jr. and Sonja Lanehart) and the Roswell Folk and Heritage Bureau, to document language and life in the community. Preliminary work indicates extended contact-induced language shift, observed in both the English and Spanish of bilingual communities (Wilson 2013, Limerick 2014). We have argued that the Mid-Atlantic US in general and Roswell, GA in particular represent an ideal test case for studying emergent speech communities in that it displays several of the benchmarks of demographic change characteristic of American urbanization during the end of the twentieth century. The combination of demographic and linguistic factors exhibited in Roswell offers a compelling new case study in our attempt to answer questions about the emergence of language patterns in the presence of relative social, ethnic, and linguistic heterogeneity. In the proposed study, we assume the perspective of individual speakers as loci for the adaptation and innovation of social practices, in this case manifested by language variables. The aggregate affect of individual speaker behavior is then proposed as a way of representing the language of a speech community. By observing the linguistic behavior of Spanish speaking residents in Roswell, this study takes advantage of a timely opportunity to observe patterns of language use as a function of the social practices of disparate communities of language users.

### Indigenous languages in Latin America: Contact, Shift, and Maintenance
In coordination with the Latin American Indigenous Languages Initiative, this project seeks to provide a forum for faculty and students interested in working with documenting and researching indigenous languages spoken in Central and South America. We are particularly interested in the linguistic and social outcomes of the contact between these languages and Spanish (and Portuguese). Our broader objectives with this project are to: (a) provide documentation support for researchers working with endangered languages in Latin American, (b) create corpus resources for use in scholarly and educational endeavors, and (c) provide faculty and students with resources for studying (and possibly teaching) these languages.

1.  [Bethany Bateman McDonald (UGA, Department of Romance Languages at the University of Georgia)](https://www.rom.uga.edu/directory/people/bethany-bateman-mcdonald)
2.  [Chad Howe (UGA, Departments of Romance Languages and Linguistics)](https://chadhoweuga.github.io/chowe/index.html)
3.  [Sarah Hubbel (UGA, Department of Romance Languages at the University of Georgia)](https://www.rom.uga.edu/directory/people/sarah-bigger)

**Descripción**

Nuestro objetivo con este taller es ofrecer una introducción general al uso de [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) para la trascripción, la anotación y el análisis de archivos orales (y visuales). ELAN es distribuido por [The Language Archive](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/) y se puede utilizar, gratuitamente, tanto con un PC como con un MAC (y Linux). Este taller ofrecerá un resumen de las funciones básicas de ELAN como la manipulación de los archivos orales y la transcripción de entrevistas con distintos niveles de análisis (p.e. oración, palabra, etc.). Los participantes tendrán acceso a materiales en español (y muestras en el quechua) que se utilizarán durante el taller. 

Los materiales para este taller [se pueden encontrar aquí](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m4M8T6oROfO4rj78V7ccQJbpi8yqw2Rn/view?usp=sharing). Esta carpeta contiene los siguientes archivos:
